# Retail A/B Test
## Task description
On the current version of the landing page, the user first selects a retailer, goes to the catalog, searches for the goods he needs, and only then can he find out that there may not be a selected store at his address. We want to test the hypothesis that choosing an address before the store selection stage will help to avoid “wry” scenarios without increasing bounces from the landing itself.
